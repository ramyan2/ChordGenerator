## Code Review #1
### Wrote a setup function in my ofApp cpp to play an audio mp3 file. In this I loaded the file, corrected the volume, and played the file. 
### Utilized the ofSound library to create an ofSoundPlayer object and perform its methods such as load, setVolume, and play that I use in my setup function.
