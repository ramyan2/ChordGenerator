# CS 126 Music Generator Development Log
## Code Review #1
* Wrote a setup function in my ofApp cpp to play an audio mp3 file. In this I loaded the file, corrected the volume, and played the file. 
* Utilized the ofSound library to create an ofSoundPlayer object and perform its methods such as load, setVolume, and play that I use in my setup function.
## Code Review #2
* Wrote in my keyPressed function in my ofApp cpp to play an audio mp3 file for every note on the scale, so that when the user presses the letter of their desired note they can hear the sound of the note. 
* User must enter uppercase letter for sharps.
