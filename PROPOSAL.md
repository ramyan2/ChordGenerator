This application is compatible with the sound and graphical abilities of openFrameworks. I plan to use 2D, maybe 3D, shapes to represent a black and white keyboard consisting of all the notes on a scale, including sharps and flats. Next to this keyboard will be 4 buttons saying Augmented, Diminised, Major, and Minor. Through this I plan on being able to see a keyboard with every note along with being able to select one note on this piano, hear the pitch, then have the option to hear an augmented, diminished, major, or minor key of this note. This application will provide a nice graphical representation of the keyboard along with displaying all the notes of it's corresponding keys. This is where it is necessary for me to use the open along with a nice audio representation when you click on a note on the keyboard.
